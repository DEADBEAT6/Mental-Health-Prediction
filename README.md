# Mental-Health-Prediction

The project titled "Mental Health Prediction Using Genetic Algorithm" aims to develop a
predictive model for mental health outcomes utilizing genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms,
inspired by the process of natural selection, will be employed to optimize the selection of
relevant features from genetic data for predicting mental health conditions. The project
involves collecting genetic information from individuals and leveraging advanced machine
learning techniques to identify patterns and associations between genetic markers and mental
health disorders. The proposed model seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of mental
health prediction by integrating genetic data, potentially leading to more personalized and
targeted interventions for individuals at risk. The outcome of this project has the potential to
contribute to advancements in early detection and intervention strategies for mental health
disorders based on an individual's genetic profile.
